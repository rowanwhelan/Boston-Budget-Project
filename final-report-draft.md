# Boston Budgetary Analysis Project
## Introduction
https://youtu.be/_ajM9b9Qr54
For our CS 506: Data Science Tools and Applications, our group analyzed budget data for the US city of Boston. We observed historical trends and created expectations for the upcoming fiscal year 2025. Our analysis focused largely on contextualizing the budget through polished visualization techniques. Additionally, we built a model capable of predicting annual budgetary allotments. Depending on the depth of our data, this was more feasible for certain datasets than others. For instance, one dataset only provided four years' worth of data, which limited accurate modeling. Nonetheless, we successfully uncovered patterns in Boston's budget allocation and spending strategies.

## Data
The data that needs to be collected and visualized is a mix of two pre-provided datasets [detailing the operating](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/operating-budget/resource/8f2971f0-7a0d-401d-8376-0289e3b810ba) and [capital budget of the city](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/capital-budget/resource/c62d666e-27ea-4c03-9cb1-d3a81a1fb641), as well as various other datasets that may include information on domestic 

## Data Processing 
Our data cleaning process included:
1. **Converting Budget Values**: Removing commas and converting budget columns to numerical format.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Using forward and backward filling methods to address gaps.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating lag features to aid in predictive modeling.
4. **One-Hot Encoding**: Encoding categorical variables to improve model performance.

## Reproducing Our Results
### For Initial Visualizations and Statistics 
#### Step 1: Set Up a Python Virtual Environment

1. Navigate to the root directory of your project using the terminal or command prompt.
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```
2. Create a virtual environment by running the following command:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

#### Step 2: Install Required Packages

1. With the virtual environment activated, install the necessary packages specified in your `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

#### Step 3: Run Python Scripts

1. Execute all Python scripts in the projectâ€™s root directory using:
    ```bash
    for file in *.py; do python "$file"; done
    ```
    (For Windows, execute each file individually or use an equivalent batch command.)

#### Step 4: Run Jupyter Notebooks

1. Ensure Jupyter Notebook is installed. If not, install it:
    ```bash
    pip install jupyter
    ```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3. Navigate to each `.ipynb` file and execute all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## The Model

The primary model implemented in `budget_modeling.py` is a Gradient Boosting Regressor, designed to identify macro-level trends in Boston's budget data. The modeling strategy focuses on long-term insights rather than precision for individual data points. Key aspects include:

1. **Performance Characteristics:**
   - The model performs well in identifying broader budgetary trends. For instance, it successfully captures the peak in 2008 followed by a decrease due to the financial crisis, then tracks the subsequent recovery.
   - It is less effective in scenarios with limited forewarning, such as sudden increases in healthcare spending due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

2. **Trade-offs and Justifications:**
   - While the model does not excel in predicting exact annual budgets, it is highly effective for policy-level decisions. This aligns with the project goals, emphasizing trend analysis over precise predictions.
   - Examples of the model's trend-tracking ability are visualized in `/model_examples/Example1.png` (Boston-specific) and `/model_examples/Example2.png` (multi-city).

3. **Improvements and Enhancements:**
   - Recent iterations of the model incorporate year and one-hot encoding of budget types, improving accuracy.
   - A singular model for Boston has been developed, featuring iterative predictions and interactive graph generation. This model demonstrates a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of approximately 30,000, significantly outperforming the overall model.

4. **Limitations:**
   - The model struggles with datasets where trends are unclear or metrics are undefined. For example, it fails to predict New York's total budget accurately.
   - Certain edge cases reveal bugs, such as predicting all zeros for New York in 2003.

5. **Visualization and Interpretability:**
   - Most effort was dedicated to creating effective visualizations to support policy discussions. The model's outputs, while not flawless, are highly interpretable and align with the project's goals.

### Conclusions
The project successfully identified patterns in Boston's budgeting trends and produced a predictive model for future budgets. While some limitations exist, such as short timeframes for data, the overall approach provides a framework for similar analyses in other cities.
