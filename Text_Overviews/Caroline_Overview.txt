        ******EXPENSE CATEGORY******
--Expense Category Breakdown--
    Purpose is to provide a comprehensive statistical breakdown of spending by expense category (e.g., Personnel Services, Equipment, etc.) 
    across multiple fiscal years (FY22–FY25). This was accomplished by data cleaning and aggregation to 1. ensure consistency by converting 
    spending columns to numeric and handling missing values and 2. to calculate statistics for spending across all years. Provides an 
    overview of highest and lowest spending categories, and year-over-year spending changes by category, enabling analysis of budget trends 
    and spending stability.

--Expense Category Visuals--
	Purpose is to create visualizations that illustrate how the FY25 budget is distributed across various expense categories and how spending 
    has changed over the past few years. The FY25 Budget Pie Chart shows the percentage breakdown of budget allocation by category, making it 
    easier to identify which areas receive significant portions of the budget. The pie chart visualizing the FY25 budget emphasizes how much of 
    the budget is concentrated within a few categories (Personnel Services and Contractual Services). Smaller categories are likely insignificant 
    in proportion, highlighting the City’s focus on human resources and essential services. The Spending Over Time by Expense Category line chart 
    demonstrates budget changes across years (FY22-FY25), allowing the identification of trends and shifts in spending priorities over time.

--Expense Category Report--
    This report lists total and average spending, year-to-year changes, and notable high- and low-spending categories, making it accessible to understand budget patterns. 
    - Overall spending trends: Personnel Services had the highest spending, reaching $8.42 billion, while Equipment had the lowest at $150.6 million. This substantial 
        difference (as well as the standard deviation of 741.1 million) suggests a strategic prioritization of personnel-related expenses over other operational needs like equipment.
    - Annual spending trends: Each year from FY22 to FY25 shows an increase in total spending. Per-year average spending also steadily increased each year, reflecting either 
        an expanding budget or rising operational costs. The consistent increase in maximum spending year-to-year (with Personnel Services being the top category) suggests 
        this expense category’s demand is growing or that more resources are allocated to support personnel needs.
    - Spending distribution: The most significant expenditures are in Personnel Services and Contractual Services, while Equipment has consistently the lowest spending. 
        This may reflect a prioritization towards operational continuity (people and contracts) over material assets or one-time expenses. Variance (as indicated by 
        the standard deviation) increases over the years, meaning that as the budget grows, disparities between the highest- and lowest-spending categories also widen.

        ******CABINET******
--Cabinet Breakdown--
    Purpose is to provide a comprehensive statistical breakdown of spending by city cabinet (i.e., departments or divisions within the city government) across multiple 
    fiscal years (FY22–FY25). This was accomplished by data cleaning and aggregation to 1. ensure consistency by converting spending columns to numeric and handling missing 
    values and 2. to calculate statistics for spending across all years. Provides an overview of highest and lowest spending cabinets, and year-over-year spending changes 
    by cabinet, enabling analysis of budget trends and spending stability.

--Cabinet Visuals--
	Purpose is to create visualizations that illustrate how the FY25 budget is distributed across various city cabinets and how spending has changed over the past few years. 
    The FY25 Budget Pie Chart shows the percentage breakdown of budget allocation by cabinet, making it easier to identify which receive significant portions of the budget. 
    The Spending Over Time by Cabinet line chart demonstrates budget changes across years (FY22-FY25), allowing the identification of trends and shifts in spending priorities over time.

--Cabinet Report--
    This report lists total and average spending, year-to-year changes, and notable high- and low-spending cabinets, making it accessible to understand budget patterns. 
    - Overall spending trends: Certain cabinets, likely those handling extensive operational tasks (such as Public Safety, Public Works), are high-spending, while other administrative 
        or less resource-intensive cabinets spend significantly less. The cabinet’s spending reflects similar totals to expense categories, but it’s spread across fewer entities (7 expense 
        categories versus more cabinets), resulting in less extreme differences in the average and standard deviations.
    - Top and bottom spending cabinets: The cabinet with the highest spending likely corresponds to a key service-delivering department (e.g., Public Safety, which might include police, 
        fire departments). Cabinets with lower spending are likely more specialized departments or those not requiring as many resources, such as certain administrative or regulatory offices. 
        This discrepancy indicates an operational focus on public-facing services.
    - Trends over time: Just as expense categories increase annually, cabinet allocations likely reflect growing budgets. Cabinets associated with essential city functions 
        (e.g., housing, public safety, transportation) might show consistent growth, aligned with their responsibility for maintaining the city’s critical infrastructure and services. 
        This growth trajectory signals that as budgetary resources expand, so does investment in foundational services that support Boston’s residents, aligning with our Team’s goal 
        of improving quality of life.
