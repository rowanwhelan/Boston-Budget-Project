*Work actually done
I added data showing projected and revised revenue for the city of Philidelphia along with visualizations.
Will be adding budgets for other major metropolitan cities.
Also added data for demographics of the city of boston, housing index prices over time, and poverty status over time.

*Plans and ideas
There were interesting trends within the projected vs. revised budgets that I'd like to explore within other major cities in the us.
I also would like to check budgets compared to market indicators over time. (Housing index, S&P, CPI)
Could also be cool to check out other diferentiating trends compared to budget like climate and if they have any effect in different cities.
