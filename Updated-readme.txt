# Boston-Budget-Project
For this project, the group will be analyzing data and using this analysis to create a presentation for what the City of Boston's Budget should be for the upcoming fiscal year 2025.\

The goal of this project is to analyze the City of Boston's spending and compare it with projected spending to find patterns in the way the city of Boston spends its money. We will also evaluate the City of Boston's plans to acquire and improve its assets.\

The data that needs to be collected and visualized is a mix of the provided data set detailing the operating and capital budget of the city and a selection of supporting data that is currently planned to include domestic product trends, employment statistics, and housing inventory data.\

We plan to model this data by comparing features in this data to establish trends and training models to approximate these trends. For example, we might compare how the price of housing in Boston correlates to the city's budget for Fair Housing and Equity. We might use this comparison to see if the City is adequately making housing affordable and acquirable for all. \

We will visualize this data using scatter plots of two different features graphed together and line graphs that represent the changes over time in our data.\

The current testing plan is to exclude 20% of our data at random as testing data. Then once we have a model that is appropriately trained on the testing and training data, we will predict the upcoming fiscal year's budget and compare it with the approved budget.\

Our Midterm deliverable will include:
  All of the data we intend to use tAo create this presentation cleaned and visualizable.
  A github workflow which runs and tests these visualization methods.
  A README on how to get the code running and a MAKEFILE to download dependencies, test the code, and run the processes.\


Our Final deliverable will include: 
  All code and cleaned datasets upload onto designated platform
  All code used to change the datasets and create visualizations â€“ including cleaning and any preparation.
  Detailed README describing how to get code running, description of what each code file is supposed to do, methodology used,   etc.s
  A Final Report with: 
  Answer the base questions and the extension questions (listed further below). 
  Details on methodology used. 
  Visualizations for both phases of the project
  The deliverable for the base questions should include a minimum of 5-7 visualizations (see here for recommendations) that address the base questions
  A Presentation with: 
  Detailed statistical summary that includes key findings
  Best/most important visualizations for support
